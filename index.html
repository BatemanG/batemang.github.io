      <div><hr></div>
      <p> 4th year Maths student due to complete a masters at Warwick in <b>June 2024.</b> I have a passion
        for pure maths, in particular Typology and Algebra, achieving <b>85%</b> in my 3rd year. 
        I have averaged <b>95%+ </b> in all my Programming modules.  
        Keen sportsman with a focus on squash having represented Warwick University at squash and been part of the University TWP (Team Warwick Performance) Programme.

          The hyperbolic plane stands as a captivating departure from our conventional understanding of geometry,
          particularly when compared to the familiar "Euclidean" spaces. In a traditional flat plane,
          the sum of angles within a triangle is 180 degrees. Yet, in the hyperbolic realm, this total dips below 180 degrees.
          Such a deviation might seem perplexing initially,
          but it unlocks a treasure trove of unique patterns and behaviors unseen in our common experiences. For context, 
          think of the "Euclidean" plane as a space of constant 0 curvature, and a sphere as one of constant positive curvature.
          In contrast, the hyperbolic plane boasts a constant curvature of -1. This website provides a hands-on journey through 
          the hyperbolic domain, immersing users in its spellbinding patterns and forms. And while the underlying mathematics—replete
          with concepts like negative curvature and hyperbolic trigonometry—can be complex, our platform demystifies it for a broader
          audience. Perhaps the most intriguing revelation is that every line depicted on this site, despite appearing curved to our
          eyes, is truly straight within the context of hyperbolic geometry.
